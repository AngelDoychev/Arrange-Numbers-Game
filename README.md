<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This is a java project build entirely on java. The project itself
is a spin on the old arranging numbers game with a feature to 
choose the size of the game in order to make it dynamic and more fun.
There is a limit on how big you can make the game though. The limit is
what the java text rendering system can render before text is converted to "..."
for being too little.



### Built With

The project was build o java with no dependencies 
and can be wrapped in a jar to be run on its own.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

- You can choose the size of the grid in the game which makes it
dynamic and more fun to play.
- The point of the game is to arrange the numbers in an ascending order by
switching places with the empty square.
